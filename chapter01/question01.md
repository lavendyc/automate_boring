Please write an interactive program that does the following work:

1. Promote the user to under an integer N. It's guaranteed that N is positive and falls in the range of integer type. 

2. Promote the user to under a length L. It's guaranteed that L is equal or longer than the number of digits of N

3. Output the number N to the full length of L. If N is shorter than L, using proper amount of leading zeros.

Example 1:
```shell
Please input number N: 123
Please input length L: 3
Output: 123
```

Example 2:
```shell
Please input number N: 1
Please input length L: 5
Output: 00001
```
