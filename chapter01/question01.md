Please write an interactive program that does the following work:

1. Promote the user to enter an integer N. It's guaranteed that N is positive and falls in the range of integer type. 

2. Promote the user to enter a length L. It's guaranteed that L is equal or bigger than the number of digits of N

3. Output the number N to the full length of L. If N is shorter than L, you should output with proper number of leading zeros.

Example 1:
```shell
Please input number N: 123
Please input length L: 3
Output: 123
```

Example 2:
```shell
Please input number N: 1
Please input length L: 5
Output: 00001
```
